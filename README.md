# React capstone project - Metrics webapp

In this React capstone project I built a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that a I created making use of React and Redux.

I selected an API that provides numeric data about Air Pollution across the globe and then built the webapp around it. ![screenshoot](./src/images/countries.png) ![screenshoot2](./src/images/homepage.png)

- ESlint (A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in JavaScript codes)
- Redux
